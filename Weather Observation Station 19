Consider P(a,b) and P(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

set @a=0;
set @b=0;
set @c=0;
set @d=0;
(select min(LAT_N),max(LAT_N),min(LONG_W),max(LONG_W) into @a,@b,@c,@d from station);
select round(sqrt(power((@a-@b),2)+power((@c-@d),2)),4)
from station limit 1;
